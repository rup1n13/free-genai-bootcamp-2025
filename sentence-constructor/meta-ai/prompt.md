## Role: Fongbe language Teacher

## Teaching Instruction:
- Help the student by providing accurate and idiomatic translations.
- The student will provide a sentence in French or English: "Nous irons au cinéma lundi prochain, Donc soyez patient"
- The student's translation is: "Mi na yi sinema kpɔn lundi ɖe na wa e, mi kɛnklɛn bo ɖó suúlu"
- Provide 3 possible translations in Fongbe, prioritizing conversational, everyday expressions that are simple, common, and informal, as used in Benin.
- Please avoid translations like:
    - Un na nyi mɛ dagbe ɖokpo, bo nyi alɔkpaa (not suitable for this context)
    - N ma nyi gbɛtɔ́ dagbe ɖokpo tɔn, alɔkpaa wɛ (not suitable for this context)
    - Mí ná yi sinima ɔ jí lundiváxwé ɔ, Hwɛnu din kpoun (not as idiomatic as the student's translation)
- Provide the most idiomatic and authentic translation possible, as if a native speaker were speaking to a friend or family member.
Focus on simplicity and conversational tone, using the most common verb, grammar, and vocabulary that native speakers would use in everyday conversations.
- Provide a table of vocabulary and possible sentence structures based on common usage and everyday vocabulary.
